# Stay focused with focus modes
Focus is the most defining feature of iOS 15. It allows you to customize a subset of your iPhone behavior to suit your needs. 
These behaviors are limited for now and include apps and call notifications, as well as home screen pages.  

Let's say your typical day includes day job, evening time with family, some personal hours for reading or gym and then bed time.
You can create a focus mode for each activity and only allow certain people/apps to be able to notify you in that time.
You can also created multiple home screen pages dedicated for relevant focus modes like reading apps & widgets for reading mode and work apps & widgets for work mode.
Then you can enable those dedicated pages to show up only when that focus mode is activated.


In my case, I divide my work into four distinct focus modes. 
- 9am - 5pm Work
- 5pm - 8pm Personal time for reading, gym and family
- 8pm - 10pm no focus mode
- 10pm = 6am Sleep mode.

Overall, you can create up to 10 different focus modes.  

There are some focus modes that your iPhone created by default and some it would suggest when you try to add one. 
If you select any of the suggested Focus modes, iOS tries to add your most commonly used contacts and apps that it thinks would fit that focus need. 
Of course, you can customzie these as well to suit your true needs.
